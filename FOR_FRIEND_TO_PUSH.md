# Instructions for B-Himanshu19 to Push the Code

## Quick Steps for Your Friend

Since you're helping with the project, your friend (B-Himanshu19) needs to push the code themselves.

## Option 1: Friend Gets the Code and Pushes

### Step 1: Share the Code
You can:
- Zip the entire `sweet-shop-management` folder and send it
- OR use a file sharing service
- OR your friend can clone from your GitHub (if you have it there)

### Step 2: Friend Runs These Commands

After your friend gets the code folder:

```powershell
# Navigate to the project folder
cd sweet-shop-management

# Add remote (if not already done)
git remote add origin https://github.com/B-Himanshu19/Sweet-shop.git

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push all code
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Friend Clones from Your GitHub (If You Have It)

If you have your own GitHub repository with this code:

1. You push to your own GitHub first
2. Friend clones from your repo
3. Friend changes remote and pushes to their repo

## Option 3: Use GitHub Desktop or Web Interface

Your friend can:
1. Download the code as ZIP
2. Upload files directly via GitHub web interface
3. Or use GitHub Desktop app

## Current Setup

✅ Remote is already configured: `https://github.com/B-Himanshu19/Sweet-shop.git`  
✅ All code is committed and ready  
✅ Just needs to be pushed by repository owner

## What Your Friend Needs

1. The entire `sweet-shop-management` folder
2. Run: `git push -u origin main` from that folder

That's it! The code is ready to push.
